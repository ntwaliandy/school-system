00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,731
(suspenseful music)

3
00:01:10,378 --> 00:01:12,027
How much further?

4
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:18,246
- Uncle Ammon, how far shall we go?
- Until I say we've walked enough.

5
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:35,802
Can't we just stop and rest for a bit?

6
00:01:44,903 --> 00:01:48,040
(fast paced drumming)

7
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,550
(singing in foreign language)

8
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:22,920
This spot will do.

9
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:33,245
- What is that?
- Dig.

10
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,364
- Dig? Dig what?
- Dig a hole.

11
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:40,984
- I'm not here to dig for you!
- You're here because you were too curious.

12
00:02:41,883 --> 00:02:46,616
- But why should I dig a hole?
- Because I say so. Take it!

13
00:03:00,478 --> 00:03:03,482
(suspenseful music)

14
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:07,254
(panting)

15
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:38,018
(shovel clanking)

16
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:43,361
Done. I'm really hungry.

17
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:46,126
Then eat.

18
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,500
- Don't you want to join me?
- I'm not hungry.

19
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:03,279
Don't be angry, uncle. I didn't mean it.
I'm just tired and hungry.

20
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:10,842
I'm not angry, but you should
have stayed away from it.

21
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:18,130
This was not something you were supposed
to see. That's why you are here now.

22
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,513
Otherwise, I would have taken
this trip alone.

23
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:27,132
(low roaring)

24
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:32,513
Don't touch it.

25
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:36,731
It's just a box.
What is wrong with you?

26
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:44,666
- What happens next?
- We must bury it.

27
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:51,260
Bury it? Did we walk for
two days to bury a box?

28
00:04:57,477 --> 00:04:58,766
Yes.

29
00:05:06,822 --> 00:05:08,096
Why?

30
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:18,717
(thudding)

31
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:28,561
I think you've heard the stories.

32
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:30,764
Yes.

33
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,037
Then you know why.

34
00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:37,796
Come on! They are just
spooky stories for kids.

35
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:39,958
They are true!

36
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,608
It will be found.

37
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:51,601
Do as you like, old fool.
Bury it if it makes you feel better.

38
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:54,141
Nobody is going to
find it out here.

39
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:59,712
It was found before and
it will be found again.

40
00:06:00,415 --> 00:06:05,845
Who would look for a box here?
There's nothing but snakes and scorpions.

41
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:16,216
This box will be found.

42
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:43,737
Next time you want to teach
me a lesson, do it at home.

43
00:06:44,526 --> 00:06:49,242
You didn't have to drag me here.
Wait till people hear this story.

44
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:53,868
- Nobody has to know we were here.
- Nobody will find out.

45
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:58,287
- But someone already knows.
- Who?

46
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:00,419
(gun firing)

47
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:04,557
(ominous string music)

48
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:25,911
(speaking in foreign language)

49
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,612
(gun firing)

50
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:10,223
(eerie orchestral music)

51
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,781
(gentle string music)

52
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:57,796
(laptop slamming)

53
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:01,398
(clicking)
(ringing)

54
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,502
God damn it.

55
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:05,669
(ringing)

56
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,006
Oh, here we go.

57
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:09,405
Hello?

58
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:10,774
[Brice] Molly, it's me.

59
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,576
Ah, good morning, Me.

60
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,377
Starting early today are we, Me?

61
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:16,413
Listen, I've been online
for the past couple of hours

62
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,414
looking at all the usual sites,

63
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,616
and we're not on any of
the top lists, not one.

64
00:10:20,618 --> 00:10:22,718
And you're calling to
tell me this because?

65
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,154
Well who else am I gonna call?

66
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,021
Okay, first of all, calm down.

67
00:10:26,023 --> 00:10:27,957
You're gonna give yourself an
aneurism.

68
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,860
Second, it's gonna be fine.

69
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,428
I know, I'm sorry, I...

70
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,963
This was supposed to be fun,
remember?

71
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:37,167
I'm sorry, I just, I need
this to be a big season or...

72
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,034
It will be.

73
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:39,502
I'm gonna be at the office soon,
okay?

74
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:40,470
I'm heading over there now.

75
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:41,605
You stay by the phone.

76
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,672
Maybe things will pick up.

77
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:43,939
I'll be in soon.

78
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:45,741
[Molly] Okay, see you soon.

79
00:10:45,743 --> 00:10:46,745
All right.

80
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,193
(screaming)

81
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:06,599
(laughing)

82
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:17,576
(clock chiming)

83
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:24,783
(bell ringing)

84
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:37,660
[Ramona] Looking for
anything in particular?

85
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:41,066
Not really, just looking
around, thanks.

86
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,836
(clocks ticking)

87
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,041
Some amazing stuff in here.

88
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,511
Is it authentic?

89
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,315
It is, hence the price.

90
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:00,986
Holy shit.

91
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:06,789
To most, that dream catcher
would be

92
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,862
nothing more than a decorative
piece,

93
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:13,630
something to put out on the
patio.

94
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:17,770
But to that one person out
there, the right person,

95
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,271
someone plagued with
nightmares for instance,

96
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:24,006
it is nearly priceless.

97
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:25,641
I don't know if I'm
your bread and butter

98
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:30,212
type of customer, but your
shop is speaking my language.

99
00:12:30,214 --> 00:12:31,750
Incredible stuff.

100
00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:37,790
Have you ever heard of escape
rooms?

101
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:41,824
I run a popular one
here in town, Deranged.

102
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:43,526
Maybe you've heard of it?

103
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:45,127
It's a pretty cool deal.

104
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:46,596
You should try it some time.

105
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:49,632
Listen, I'm lookin' for
somethin' to,

106
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:52,936
to spice it up a little
bit, something special,

107
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,270
know what I mean?

108
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:56,840
I gotta stay a cut above the,

109
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,707
(low rumbling music)

110
00:12:58,709 --> 00:12:59,808
above the competition.

111
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,313
[Ramona?] You see anything
to your liking so far?

112
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,247
Yeah, actually I do.

113
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:06,982
What is that?

114
00:13:06,984 --> 00:13:09,586
Oh, nothing you'd be
interested in.

115
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,821
I'm interested, it's perfect.

116
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:13,323
It's nice and foreboding.

117
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,659
It is, but it's not for sale.

118
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:16,760
Are you sure?

119
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:17,794
[Ramona?] Quite sure.

120
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:18,662
What am I missing?

121
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,698
You uh, you sell things here,
right?

122
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,900
I do, and some things, I do
not sell.

123
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:26,937
This box is not to be trifled
with.

124
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,939
It's no toy, no simple decor
piece.

125
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:32,308
Why don't you try one of the
iron cast

126
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,611
candle holders over there?

127
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:37,713
I'm sure that it would do wonders
for your room's ambiance.

128
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:40,717
Nah, that box, that box has me
hooked.

129
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,952
It just,

130
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,788
It has a way of doing that.

131
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,223
What, it's got voodoo powers
coursing through it, huh?

132
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:50,827
Voodoo has nothing to do with
it.

133
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,263
That box has a history, a dark
one.

134
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,198
You're just reeling me in more
and more,

135
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,002
you know that, right?

136
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,638
It's called the Skull Box.

137
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,177
It's considered to be,
to those in the know,

138
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,846
one of the most cursed
objects in the world,

139
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,281
right up there with
the crying boy painting

140
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:13,983
and the Annabelle doll.

141
00:14:13,985 --> 00:14:16,218
The one from the film?

142
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,889
No, the real one.

143
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,826
So what's the story?

144
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,028
No one knows where
it came from originally

145
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,996
or who made it.

146
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,265
It's reputed to hold a demon
inside of it,

147
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:31,034
a very old one.

148
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,938
All is well as long as
the box remains closed,

149
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,675
which it is, always.

150
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,742
A demon, huh?

151
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:42,212
You really believe in all that?

152
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,813
Demons are real.

153
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:46,850
It has nothing to do with
believing or disbelieving.

154
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:47,851
It simply is.

155
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,285
Well, fair enough, but
if it's so dangerous,

156
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:52,021
why keep it here?

157
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:53,256
Better here in safe hands,

158
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:57,059
than out there in the hands
of those who don't understand

159
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:59,864
or respect the power it
contains.

160
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,899
Name your price.

161
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:05,103
Not for sale.

162
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,976
(phone ringing)

163
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,780
Excuse me one moment.

164
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:24,824
Hello?

165
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,860
Yes, I do know.

166
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:30,092
Absolutely.

167
00:15:30,094 --> 00:15:33,096
(low, suspenseful music)

168
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,798
All right.

169
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,231
Don't get it wet, and whatever
you do,

170
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:38,867
don't feed it after midnight.

171
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:40,339
Okay, call me back.

172
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:44,276
(bell ringing)

173
00:15:54,752 --> 00:15:57,022
Don't say I didn't warn you.

174
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:05,260
(upbeat pop music)

175
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:06,829
(throat clearing)

176
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:08,497
Can't talk, working.

177
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:10,933
Oh, is that what we're calling
it now?

178
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:12,135
I can't write my review of the
game

179
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,837
until I play the game, can I?

180
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:14,904
Are you ready?

181
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:17,406
Are you sure you're
ready for me to be ready?

182
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:19,007
We gotta leave this
place in like two minutes

183
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:21,111
if we wanna get there on time.

184
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,879
Do we really have to go?

185
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:23,712
Yes.

186
00:16:23,714 --> 00:16:26,116
You are gonna love it babe,
promise.

187
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,049
I doubt that.

188
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:29,018
Horror is my first love.

189
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,356
Don't be jealous.

190
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:37,526
I was gonna wear that shirt
tonight.

191
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:38,962
Oh, well,

192
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:42,198
guess you're just gonna
have to come and get it.

193
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,333
This is level six, babe.

194
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:46,369
Level six, do you know how hard
it is...

195
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:47,373
Forget it.

196
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,539
Shit.

197
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,278
(phone ringing)

198
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:57,045
Hey.

199
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:58,347
Hey, you guys left yet?

200
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:00,149
[Jeff] Not yet, leaving in a
few though.

201
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:02,151
I basically have to
drag Angie to this thing

202
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:03,285
by her ankles, so hope...
(doorbell ringing)

203
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:05,490
Hey man, just one second.

204
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:11,326
Hey, nice costume, truly
terrifying.

205
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:12,330
Smart ass.

206
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:18,301
Hey Jess, Ben's here.

207
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:19,968
[Jess] Okay, I'll be right
there.

208
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,103
[Jeff] What about you guys?

209
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:23,372
I'm picking up Jess as we
speak.

210
00:17:23,374 --> 00:17:25,842
[Jeff] Cool, see you there.

211
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,044
Hey uh, tonight's the night

212
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:30,479
I'm gonna ask her to move in
with me.

213
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:32,247
You sure about this?

214
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:33,515
Yeah, I'm sure.

215
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:36,585
[Jeff] I think you're crazy
to do it, give up your domain.

216
00:17:36,587 --> 00:17:38,053
Bold move, my friend.

217
00:17:38,055 --> 00:17:40,125
Yeah, well, I love her.

218
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:42,859
Hey.

219
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,063
Ah, I gotta go.

220
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:46,929
Hi.

221
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:49,399
Uh, how long have you um,

222
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,601
what all did you hear?
(laughing)

223
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:52,467
Me?

224
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:54,336
What did I hear?

225
00:17:54,338 --> 00:17:55,470
Nothing.

226
00:17:55,472 --> 00:17:57,475
Okay, all right, good.

227
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:01,210
Go for it, tiger.

228
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:03,612
She's one of the good ones.

229
00:18:03,614 --> 00:18:04,514
I know.

230
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,082
[Jess] Okay, I'm coming.

231
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:06,850
- Hey.
- Hi.

232
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:07,950
Have fun you two.
(smacking)

233
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:08,985
Oh, thanks.
(laughing)

234
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,053
- Hi.
- Hey baby.

235
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,287
(moaning)

236
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:13,922
You look great.

237
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:14,756
Really?

238
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:16,292
Well, you are super easy to
please.

239
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:18,194
I was thinking after this
thing,

240
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:20,929
maybe we'd go out to
dinner, just the two of us?

241
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:22,398
Really?

242
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,365
That's nice.

243
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:24,467
Yeah, I thought it'd
be nice to just have

244
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:26,969
a little alone time without
the Jeff and Angie show.

245
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:28,438
(laughing)

246
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,372
You know, just a little time to
us

247
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:33,042
just to talk, whatever.

248
00:18:33,044 --> 00:18:36,012
What'd you wanna talk about?

249
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,179
Nothing, just...

250
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:38,413
Oh my god.

251
00:18:38,415 --> 00:18:40,416
You're pregnant, aren't you?

252
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:42,017
No, no, nothin' like that.

253
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:43,085
Okay.

254
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:45,655
But I do have a wife
and two kids in Wisconsin.

255
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,358
I like to call 'em my little
cheese curds.

256
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,092
We still cool?

257
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:51,995
I'm gonna order the most
expensive thing on the menu,

258
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,129
but yeah, we're cool.

259
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,265
All right, that's fair enough.

260
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,203
(upbeat pop music)

261
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:07,345
(suspenseful string music)

262
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,515
All right, uh, Jason?

263
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:14,383
[Jeff] No.

264
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:15,384
[Ben] Okay, Michael.

265
00:19:15,386 --> 00:19:16,252
[Jeff] No.

266
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:17,920
What about Pennywise?

267
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:19,155
You are killing me, man.

268
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:20,489
Please, jump into this century.

269
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:23,092
This century, what
are you talking about?

270
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:24,360
Hey, I see that.

271
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:26,062
Jess, I'm just tryin'
to stop your boyfriend

272
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,196
from embarrassing himself

273
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:30,033
with a lame costume this year,
again.

274
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,199
Oh, again?

275
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:32,601
Yeah, again.

276
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:33,536
You know what I'm talking about.

277
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:35,138
Yeah, I know what you're
talking about,

278
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,605
and the Wheeler from Return to
Oz,

279
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:39,042
that is an all-time classic.
(laughing)

280
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:42,445
Come on, I mean, remind me
what you were again last year.

281
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:45,180
Not that it needs reminding,
but I was,

282
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:47,382
babe, why don't you remind him?

283
00:19:47,384 --> 00:19:48,653
Oh, let's see.

284
00:19:49,586 --> 00:19:51,589
You were, what were you?

285
00:19:53,123 --> 00:19:55,260
Oh, that donkey man thing.

286
00:19:56,126 --> 00:19:57,128
Incorrect.

287
00:19:58,395 --> 00:20:00,996
I was Craig, the lamb mask-wearing
killer from You're Next.

288
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:04,300
Yes, of course, it's
very, very original, mm hmm.

289
00:20:04,302 --> 00:20:06,069
Now did you get your
mask in the kids section

290
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,036
with all the other 16-year old
kids?

291
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:09,471
Ooh, funny.

292
00:20:09,473 --> 00:20:12,207
The movie was rad, it's an
instant horror film classic.

293
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:14,343
[Ben] Okay, it was not and it
is not.

294
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:15,312
Can we...

295
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,146
Don't worry, they'll
tire themselves out.

296
00:20:17,148 --> 00:20:19,215
[Jeff] Modern horror classic,
it's a different thing.

297
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:21,184
[Ben] Modern horror
classic, that's an oxymoron.

298
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,052
Here, go on and take one.

299
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:24,320
Pass it on to friends.

300
00:20:24,322 --> 00:20:26,255
Is this kinda thing really
that popular?

301
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:27,489
Escape rooms?

302
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:30,493
You bet, yeah, they've been
growing over the last few years.

303
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,094
But they're really, really,
really

304
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:33,295
starting to catch fire now.

305
00:20:33,297 --> 00:20:34,162
Hm.

306
00:20:34,164 --> 00:20:35,598
Is it really that scary?

307
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,735
I'm not like the horror
aficionado that my friends are.

308
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,503
Not really a fan at all, to be
honest.

309
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,139
Oh, yeah, they're not
all horror based like ours,

310
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,074
but we topped the list
that year for a reason.

311
00:20:46,076 --> 00:20:50,746
You're gonna have a
killer time. (chuckling)

312
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:52,648
(throat clearing) I'm sorry,

313
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,449
they pay me to say things like
that.

314
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:55,450
Gotcha.

315
00:20:55,452 --> 00:20:57,419
That's what makes horror.

316
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:59,155
It was more than just CGI...

317
00:20:59,157 --> 00:20:59,823
Your mom?

318
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,323
She was an instant classic.

319
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:03,559
When I met her, she was so
gorgeous.

320
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:04,659
Ooh.
(laughing)

321
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:06,094
You son of a bitch.

322
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:06,928
- Jeff?
- Yeah.

323
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,131
Hi, I'm Brice, nice to meet
you.

324
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:10,499
I've read some of your articles
before.

325
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:12,168
You have great taste in horror.

326
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,136
- Yes I do.
- Yeah?

327
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,670
Some of us aren't so lucky,
are we Ben?

328
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:16,605
- Hi.
- Hi there.

329
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:17,373
And you are?

330
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,141
- Hi, Angie.
- Angie, pleasure.

331
00:21:19,143 --> 00:21:20,543
That must make you Jess.

332
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,777
- Yes, hi.
- Hi.

333
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:23,045
Well, welcome.

334
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:25,113
It's 8:00pm, it's your slot.

335
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:27,249
We are punctual, if nothing else
here.

336
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:30,519
Time is always at the
forefront of our minds,

337
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:33,188
as it will be with you too soon
inside.

338
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,056
Follow me.

339
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:35,024
[Jeff] Let's go.

340
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:36,191
[Angie] What are you guys
gettin' into?

341
00:21:36,193 --> 00:21:37,794
[Jess] Here we go.

342
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,798
(crickets chirping)

343
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:45,536
RJ.

344
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:51,506
Dude, you're supposed to be in
the room.

345
00:21:51,508 --> 00:21:53,109
The 8:00pm group is already with
Brice.

346
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,843
I'm going, I'm going.

347
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:56,144
And let's do the boss man a
favor

348
00:21:56,146 --> 00:21:57,479
and not blaze up at work.

349
00:21:57,481 --> 00:21:59,215
It helps me get into
character.

350
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,684
You wouldn't understand,
you're not an actor.

351
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:03,619
Oh, that makes two of us.

352
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:06,555
Next pilot season, I'm
gonna book the big one.

353
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:07,489
Bullshit.

354
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:08,791
Sorry, what was that?

355
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:10,392
I'm not paid enough for this.

356
00:22:10,394 --> 00:22:12,196
Tic tac it and run.

357
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:15,564
Have fun.

358
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:16,501
[RJ] Yep.

359
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:23,371
(door banging shut)

360
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:25,541
The concept of the escape
room's fairly simple.

361
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:28,111
You have to find a way
to unlock the front door

362
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,246
and get out, that's it.

363
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,681
You have 55 minutes to do that.

364
00:22:32,683 --> 00:22:35,551
The room is full of clues and
puzzles

365
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:37,519
that you have to use to escape.

366
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:38,688
Work together.

367
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,622
Don't overthink everything.

368
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:43,559
That being said, anything,
no matter how subtle,

369
00:22:43,561 --> 00:22:46,195
could be vital in helping you to
survive.

370
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:47,596
Ooh.
(laughing)

371
00:22:47,598 --> 00:22:50,334
Remember, every second counts.

372
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:55,373
Once we lock you in, you're in.

373
00:22:56,373 --> 00:22:59,609
There are no phones in there, no
wireless,

374
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:02,477
so your cellphones are useless.

375
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:04,746
And it's soundproof, so our
neighbors

376
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:06,515
aren't annoyed by your screams.

377
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:08,618
(laughing)

378
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,388
The only way out is to follow
the clues.

379
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,723
You ready?

380
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,194
Let's do this.

381
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,863
Let the games begin.
(clapping)

382
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:23,533
(laughing)

383
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,767
Now, follow my voice to hell.

384
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:27,469
[Jess] I don't like this at
all.

385
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:29,171
[Angie] This is your idea of a
date?

386
00:23:29,173 --> 00:23:31,239
[Jess] How long do we have
to keep these things on for?

387
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:32,374
(metal latch clanking)

388
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:34,610
[Jeff] Take it off guys.

389
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:36,411
[Jess] Oh my god.

390
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:38,547
(laughing)

391
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:42,687
(electric buzzing)
(low suspenseful music)

392
00:23:49,326 --> 00:23:50,461
[Jeff] Yeah.

393
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:52,597
Oh yeah.

394
00:24:05,209 --> 00:24:08,843
What kind of a weirdo
thinks up a place like this?

395
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:11,313
(whooshing)

396
00:24:11,315 --> 00:24:12,948
(latch clanking)

397
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,717
How do people not love horror,
huh?

398
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:17,285
You're such a geek.

399
00:24:17,287 --> 00:24:18,987
Lucky for me, you make
it up in other ways.

400
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:19,956
Mm hmm.

401
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,957
It's in my blood, babe.

402
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:25,361
And god willing, one day we
will get our script produced,

403
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:27,796
etch our names among
the titans of the genre.

404
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:31,869
[Ben] That's right. (laughing)

405
00:24:37,674 --> 00:24:39,809
Can I get a coffee please?

406
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,344
[Molly] Above my pay grade.

407
00:24:42,346 --> 00:24:43,214
Right.

408
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:49,317
Okay.

409
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,188
Come here.

410
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,329
(clicking)

411
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:01,363
[Richard On Recorder]
My name is Richard Doyle.

412
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:04,467
If you are listening to this,
then I am,

413
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,603
I am now dead.

414
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,036
My body will never be found.

415
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:11,407
I'm sure my son's disposed of it
by now,

416
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:15,347
like he did the others,
including his mother's.

417
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:19,348
I tried to stop him, I tried.

418
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,954
I saw the warning signs early
on.

419
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:24,256
Jonathan,

420
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:26,624
is not normal.

421
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,262
His mind is wrong, twisted.

422
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:35,765
When I look into his
eyes, I, I see nothing.

423
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,501
It's just emptiness.

424
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:42,037
He is in every sense of the
word, evil.

425
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,105
Evil. (laughing)

426
00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:45,807
[Richard On Recorder]
This was his killing room,

427
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:48,977
a place of pain and suffering.

428
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:52,648
There were times I would swear
the room itself was alive,

429
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:56,319
watching me, as if it,
he isn't lost to us,

430
00:25:56,321 --> 00:26:00,459
his soul has been absorbed
into the very walls themselves.

431
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,793
I've done my best to
lock him in here forever,

432
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:04,930
body and soul.

433
00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:09,765
Whatever you do, don't let him
out.

434
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:13,572
Just get out before he
gets you, and he will.

435
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:16,741
It's only a matter of,

436
00:26:17,874 --> 00:26:18,743
time.

437
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,076
Showtime.

438
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:23,611
(beeping)

439
00:26:23,613 --> 00:26:27,550
(suspenseful string music)

440
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,052
Okay, so, where do we start?

441
00:26:30,054 --> 00:26:31,821
Look around the room, take it
all in.

442
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,488
Anything could be a clue.

443
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,123
Mm, I'll be on Facebook if you
need me.

444
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,624
Uh, no wireless, remember?

445
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:38,296
Oh god, I forgot.

446
00:26:39,396 --> 00:26:40,496
Hurry up.

447
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:41,496
I'm bored already.

448
00:26:41,498 --> 00:26:45,601
Have no fear, I'm a
master at these things.

449
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:48,670
By the by, the tickets just
came online for the thing,

450
00:26:48,672 --> 00:26:50,372
35 millimeter, we are going.

451
00:26:50,374 --> 00:26:51,774
Oh hell yeah, that's the one
remake

452
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,641
that's better than the original.

453
00:26:53,643 --> 00:26:54,776
What?

454
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:56,544
That remake sucks.

455
00:26:56,546 --> 00:26:59,482
No, I'm talking about
the John Carpenter version.

456
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:02,817
You know he made a remake
of the 1954 original.

457
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:05,787
You knew there was an original,
right?

458
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:06,788
[Jeff] Yeah, of course.

459
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,858
Oh no, no no no no,
go stand in the corner.

460
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,793
You stand...

461
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,060
That's disappointing, you
disappoint.

462
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,561
You're scared of the dark.

463
00:27:12,563 --> 00:27:13,928
(laughing)

464
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,598
All right, all right,
but let's figure out

465
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,132
what we gotta do, okay?

466
00:27:17,134 --> 00:27:21,437
Look for patterns or
anything out of the ordinary,

467
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,505
positions of things.

468
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:24,939
Two chairs, upright.

469
00:27:24,941 --> 00:27:26,074
Imagine that.

470
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:28,177
(laughing)

471
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:31,546
There's a bookshelf, and
there's tons of books on it.

472
00:27:31,548 --> 00:27:32,415
Check it out.

473
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:35,150
Three black studs on the ship
thing.

474
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:36,685
We have this cabinet.

475
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:40,121
There's a lock on here
(smacking)

476
00:27:40,123 --> 00:27:42,658
with three numbers.

477
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,726
Six, six, six.

478
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,661
(chain rattling)

479
00:27:46,663 --> 00:27:47,932
What was that?

480
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,636
Came from the dark side.

481
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,004
Why don't you go check it?

482
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:59,507
(squealing) No, after
you, smart ass, you go.

483
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:03,382
Stand back, wussies,
I'll take care of this.

484
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,726
(eerie string music)

485
00:28:18,728 --> 00:28:20,399
That's pretty good.

486
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:22,765
Think we found Jonathan.

487
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,199
Who's Jonathan?

488
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:25,200
- Come on.
- Really?

489
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:29,804
Jonathan, the son, the
killer of his parents.

490
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:32,041
Oh, I guess I wasn't paying
attention.

491
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,844
[Ben] That figures.

492
00:28:34,778 --> 00:28:36,711
So what's he gonna do?

493
00:28:36,713 --> 00:28:41,115
Is he just gonna, stand
there and try to spook us?

494
00:28:41,117 --> 00:28:42,520
I don't know.

495
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:46,624
Doesn't talk much, does he?

496
00:29:07,844 --> 00:29:08,979
This is sweet.

497
00:29:12,749 --> 00:29:15,219
(low rumbling)

498
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:24,528
(voices whispering indistinctly)

499
00:29:36,873 --> 00:29:40,812
(speaking in foreign language)

500
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:47,552
(sniffing)

501
00:29:54,691 --> 00:29:57,962
(pulsing ominous music)

502
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:10,575
Hmm.

503
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:12,807
Anything?

504
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:16,013
No, unless we need to make
pancakes.

505
00:30:18,181 --> 00:30:21,585
There's some stuff up on this
mantle.

506
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:27,922
Eraser.

507
00:30:27,924 --> 00:30:30,726
Okay, I've done my part.

508
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,596
Thank you very much.

509
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:36,364
[Jeff] Check the jars, are
they empty?

510
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:37,233
[Ben] Yeah.

511
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,668
Um, we have a pattern on this
lock.

512
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,370
It's red, green, blue.

513
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:45,040
Red green blue, red
green blue, red green blue.

514
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,244
Red green blue.

515
00:30:57,321 --> 00:31:01,660
(booming)
(screaming)

516
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,259
Papa Doyle, ladies and
gentlemen.

517
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:06,797
Nice find, Angie.

518
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:14,303
Is it just me, or did it
just get really cold in here?

519
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,804
Ben, your girlfriend's nippin'
out.

520
00:31:16,806 --> 00:31:19,743
(glasses clanking)

521
00:31:23,814 --> 00:31:24,682
Ohh yes.

522
00:31:26,816 --> 00:31:28,383
The master.

523
00:31:28,385 --> 00:31:31,320
Two gold coins, definitely a
clue.

524
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,889
(coins jangling)

525
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:34,892
All right.

526
00:31:37,894 --> 00:31:39,763
Hey hey, check it out.

527
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,202
[Angie] And, what?

528
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,935
The handle's missing.

529
00:31:46,937 --> 00:31:49,004
I call that a clue.

530
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:51,407
I call that poor
craftsmanship.

531
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,740
Hmm.

532
00:31:52,742 --> 00:31:54,776
Every detail matters.

533
00:31:54,778 --> 00:31:56,745
Ah, so noted master.

534
00:31:56,747 --> 00:31:58,346
I love it when she calls me
that.

535
00:31:58,348 --> 00:32:00,349
[Angie] I thought this place
was supposed to be scary?

536
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,850
I just feel like I'm back in
school

537
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:02,784
taking my SATs.

538
00:32:02,786 --> 00:32:04,953
[Ben] You didn't think that
was scary?

539
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:06,157
A little bit.

540
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:16,668
I don't hear the phone
ringing.

541
00:32:17,699 --> 00:32:18,902
[Molly] Because it's not.

542
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,803
That's not good.

543
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,204
People should be lined up out
the door.

544
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,305
Relax, the season just
started.

545
00:32:24,307 --> 00:32:26,240
That's my point, it's opening
weekend.

546
00:32:26,242 --> 00:32:28,177
The phone should be ringin' off
the hook.

547
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:30,044
Well, you know, we're
not the hot new kid

548
00:32:30,046 --> 00:32:31,213
on the block anymore.

549
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:35,316
I mean, there's other escape
rooms popping up in town.

550
00:32:35,318 --> 00:32:38,019
We can't have another
season like last year,

551
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:39,455
or that's it, it's over.

552
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,024
[Molly] You can't win every
year, dude.

553
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,258
I mean, being voted number
one once is impressive.

554
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,460
That was two years ago.

555
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:46,861
Who gives a shit about two years
ago?

556
00:32:46,863 --> 00:32:48,130
You gotta stay relevant.

557
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:48,999
Okay.

558
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:56,304
All right, I don't really do
good with feel good talks,

559
00:32:56,306 --> 00:32:58,774
so let's just get this over
with.

560
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,309
You are too hard on yourself.

561
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,410
This is just a job, it's not who
you are.

562
00:33:02,412 --> 00:33:03,911
Well it sure as hell is now.

563
00:33:03,913 --> 00:33:04,912
I put all my money into this.

564
00:33:04,914 --> 00:33:06,515
I lost my wife over this.

565
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:07,815
Without it, who am I?

566
00:33:07,817 --> 00:33:10,351
A decent guy doing the best he
can.

567
00:33:10,353 --> 00:33:11,519
Decent, huh?

568
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:13,257
You really think so?

569
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:18,226
You see that box I brought in
earlier?

570
00:33:18,228 --> 00:33:20,829
With the skull on it?

571
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:22,464
I bought it from the
shopkeeper

572
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:24,832
at the antique store around the
block.

573
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:26,869
She said it's one of
the most cursed objects

574
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:30,072
in the world, that there's
a demon inside of it.

575
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,974
Gotta drum up business somehow,
right?

576
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,142
Pay off the mountain of
bills I have piling up.

577
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:36,844
Do you pay attention to the
horror films that you watch,

578
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:39,148
Mister Horror King?

579
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:44,085
You don't ever mess with that
weird kinda paranormal stuff.

580
00:33:44,087 --> 00:33:44,955
Ever.

581
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,355
What?

582
00:33:47,357 --> 00:33:49,957
Never took you for the
type to believe in all that.

583
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:52,427
Hey, if the demon comes
out and attacks us all,

584
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:54,563
I will duly apologize, you have
my word.

585
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:56,497
Very funny.
(phone ringing)

586
00:33:56,499 --> 00:33:58,332
Bigger the scares the
better the experience.

587
00:33:58,334 --> 00:34:00,004
Yeah, okay, okay.

588
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:06,073
Thank you for calling
Deranged, this is Molly.

589
00:34:06,075 --> 00:34:07,077
Oh, hey mom.

590
00:34:10,513 --> 00:34:12,547
Yeah, yeah it's a little slow
around here.

591
00:34:12,549 --> 00:34:14,183
Yeah, fuck off.

592
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,185
[Ben] How we lookin' on time?

593
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,323
46 minutes and counting.

594
00:34:21,024 --> 00:34:24,192
We got a black safe, anyone
check this?

595
00:34:24,194 --> 00:34:25,259
Silver lock.

596
00:34:25,261 --> 00:34:27,094
[Jeff] Yep, we need a key.

597
00:34:27,096 --> 00:34:28,563
[Ben] Round key.

598
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:30,598
[Jeff] Key, a key, a round
key.

599
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,136
Where would I be if I were a
key?

600
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,141
[Ben] Okay, round key.

601
00:34:37,373 --> 00:34:38,243
Oh boys.

602
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:41,109
I think I got somethin' for ya.

603
00:34:41,111 --> 00:34:42,310
- [Ben] Yeah?
- Yeah.

604
00:34:42,312 --> 00:34:43,612
[Ben] So what you got?

605
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:45,480
Look, see, there's symbols in
this one

606
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:47,082
and then there's shapes in that
one.

607
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:48,884
Oh yeah, good eye, Columbo.

608
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:49,551
Ah yes.

609
00:34:49,553 --> 00:34:50,551
So now what?

610
00:34:50,553 --> 00:34:53,020
So now we think, we
put our heads together.

611
00:34:53,022 --> 00:34:55,489
We have to figure out what
these patterns have in common

612
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:57,326
and how they can get us outta
here.

613
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,493
Oh, this is totally stressing
me out.

614
00:34:59,495 --> 00:35:02,063
Are you trying to stress me out,
babe?

615
00:35:02,065 --> 00:35:05,100
You know I turn into a
lioness when I get stressed.

616
00:35:05,102 --> 00:35:06,567
I don't think you need my help
for that.

617
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:08,372
[Angie] Mm, thanks.

618
00:35:11,007 --> 00:35:13,143
(buzzing)

619
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,880
What the hell?

620
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:21,419
(keys clacking)

621
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:26,520
(metal chain rattling)

622
00:35:26,522 --> 00:35:30,525
Jesus, I forgot that guy was
in here.

623
00:35:30,527 --> 00:35:33,531
(suspenseful music)

624
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:37,435
Woah.

625
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,145
[Ben] He's closer now.

626
00:35:51,147 --> 00:35:52,346
What?

627
00:35:52,348 --> 00:35:54,415
[Jess] He was against the wall
before,

628
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:57,120
or at least he was closer to it.

629
00:36:01,024 --> 00:36:03,658
Ah okay, okay, I get it.

630
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,594
So a friend of mine told
me about a escape room

631
00:36:06,596 --> 00:36:07,962
he went to about a year ago.

632
00:36:07,964 --> 00:36:08,964
It was something like this,

633
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,598
but it was zombies or something.

634
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,937
Anyway, so our friend here,
let's call him Stitchface,

635
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,605
well he's got this chain
wrapped him around,

636
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,205
it's connected to the wall.

637
00:36:18,207 --> 00:36:21,042
So, every five minutes or so, on
the dot,

638
00:36:21,044 --> 00:36:22,411
the cog releases some chain,

639
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:23,978
it gives him more room to work
with.

640
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,580
(gasping) So he gets closer to
us?

641
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:28,116
Yes, and if he gets to
us before we get out...

642
00:36:28,118 --> 00:36:28,987
What?

643
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:33,221
We die, or whatever, game
over.

644
00:36:33,223 --> 00:36:35,723
All right everybody, stakes
are raised.

645
00:36:35,725 --> 00:36:38,528
Game on, we gotta get outta
here.

646
00:36:39,495 --> 00:36:42,232
(ominous music)

647
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,504
Okay, we got the patterns on the
painting,

648
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:51,239
triangles, gotta look for that.

649
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:53,542
We got the colors, the
colors mean somethin',

650
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,609
red green blue.

651
00:36:54,611 --> 00:36:56,111
What?

652
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:57,448
I have no idea.

653
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:03,388
Just, anything, anything with
the colors.

654
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,687
Okay, don't overthink it.

655
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:06,788
Just look around.

656
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:11,195
These colors come into play
somewhere, they have to.

657
00:37:13,263 --> 00:37:14,265
Okay, think.

658
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,699
Jess, you find anything?

659
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:21,670
Um, nothing obvious, anyway.

660
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:25,406
There's just a bunch of normal
books,

661
00:37:25,408 --> 00:37:28,310
no codes written in them
or any pages missing

662
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,544
or anything like that.

663
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:31,379
Look at you getting into this.

664
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:32,380
I'm impressed.

665
00:37:32,382 --> 00:37:34,583
Well, I know that you
wanna get out of here

666
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,419
more than any of us,
so I do it all for you.

667
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,719
That's why we're BFFs.

668
00:37:38,721 --> 00:37:39,589
BFFs.

669
00:37:48,064 --> 00:37:48,732
Wait.

670
00:37:51,701 --> 00:37:52,567
What?

671
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:53,534
Of course.

672
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,803
What do you see?

673
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:56,170
Uh, books.

674
00:37:56,172 --> 00:37:57,172
[Jeff] And?

675
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:59,373
Enlighten us already.

676
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:00,808
Red,

677
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,678
green,

678
00:38:02,645 --> 00:38:04,145
blue.

679
00:38:04,147 --> 00:38:05,346
- Oh.
- [Ben] Shit.

680
00:38:05,348 --> 00:38:06,380
Five, three, four,

681
00:38:06,382 --> 00:38:07,281
five three four.

682
00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:10,284
Oh, there we go kid, yes.
(laughing)

683
00:38:10,286 --> 00:38:13,587
Five, three, and four.
(lock clicking)

684
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:14,658
[Jess] Ooh.

685
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:18,228
Aha.

686
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:21,129
We have a key ladies and
gentlemen.

687
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:22,029
All right.

688
00:38:22,031 --> 00:38:24,299
[Jeff] And it does not fit
this lock.

689
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:25,500
What else needs a key?

690
00:38:25,502 --> 00:38:27,301
- Um, safe, the safe.
- Yes.

691
00:38:27,303 --> 00:38:29,337
Safe, perfect.

692
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:33,308
Bring it over here.
(grunting)

693
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,643
Silver round key for a silver
round lock,

694
00:38:35,645 --> 00:38:37,145
that makes sense.

695
00:38:37,147 --> 00:38:41,152
Ooh, we're gonna be outta
here in half the time.

696
00:38:43,419 --> 00:38:44,853
Scissors.

697
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,791
Um, what needs cutting?

698
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,257
Creeper's eyeballs.

699
00:38:50,259 --> 00:38:51,091
Babe.

700
00:38:51,093 --> 00:38:53,295
Look at him, he's freaking me
out.

701
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,362
He keeps staring.

702
00:38:55,364 --> 00:38:58,567
He better not be staring at my
boobs.

703
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,502
I think he's looking at my boobs
you guys.

704
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,770
I can't say I blame the guy.

705
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,370
Angie, let's not heckle

706
00:39:03,372 --> 00:39:05,406
the psychotic hillbilly, all
right?

707
00:39:05,408 --> 00:39:07,241
He probably hasn't seen
any in a long time.

708
00:39:07,243 --> 00:39:08,409
- True.
- Yeah, exactly.

709
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:11,612
I'd be the same way if I was
workin' at an escape room,

710
00:39:11,614 --> 00:39:13,781
the silent emotionless killer.

711
00:39:13,783 --> 00:39:15,683
Yeah, like Mikey Myers.

712
00:39:15,685 --> 00:39:18,319
Eh, but you'd probably play
him in like the fifth one,

713
00:39:18,321 --> 00:39:19,754
where he cries and shit.

714
00:39:19,756 --> 00:39:20,621
Yeah.

715
00:39:20,623 --> 00:39:21,323
He never cried, so...

716
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,525
Oh, yes, yes, fifth Halloween.

717
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,161
Girl was in the coffin, he's
lookin' over her, had the...

718
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,429
[Jeff] Ooh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah yeah, my bad.

719
00:39:28,431 --> 00:39:29,830
- Boys, hey.
- Hey.

720
00:39:29,832 --> 00:39:31,232
Remember that thing?

721
00:39:31,234 --> 00:39:31,900
Right, time.

722
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,201
Time, time, time, time.

723
00:39:33,203 --> 00:39:34,268
Okay, scissors.

724
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,538
Anything that needs cutting?

725
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,806
Anything.

726
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,841
- I don't know.
- The thing?

727
00:39:39,843 --> 00:39:41,609
We got 37 minutes.

728
00:39:41,611 --> 00:39:44,281
All right, what are we missing?

729
00:39:45,482 --> 00:39:48,482
Maybe we should look a little
deeper into the dark side.

730
00:39:48,484 --> 00:39:49,350
Ladies?

731
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:50,384
Hm, bite me.

732
00:39:50,386 --> 00:39:51,585
After you, please.

733
00:39:51,587 --> 00:39:53,223
Okay, here we go.

734
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,602
Oh, we got somethin' here.

735
00:40:07,437 --> 00:40:09,640
(laughing)

736
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:11,772
We found it.

737
00:40:11,774 --> 00:40:14,578
(chain rattling)

738
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,649
(ominous music)

739
00:40:27,623 --> 00:40:28,692
What is it?

740
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:33,428
[Jeff] All right.

741
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,462
What do we got?

742
00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:36,565
(laughing)

743
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,500
[Jeff] Voila.

744
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,600
- Oh.
- A handle.

745
00:40:39,602 --> 00:40:41,870
I'm the master, thank you very
much.

746
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:44,205
Thank you, thank you thank you
thank you.

747
00:40:44,207 --> 00:40:47,942
(stabbing)
(groaning)

748
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:48,812
Dude.

749
00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:54,982
(stabbing)
(screaming)

750
00:40:54,984 --> 00:40:56,250
(thudding)

751
00:40:56,252 --> 00:40:58,522
(screaming)

752
00:41:05,995 --> 00:41:08,398
(dripping)

753
00:41:09,765 --> 00:41:11,935
(whacking)

754
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,004
Oh my god!

755
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,408
Jesus Christ!

756
00:41:18,507 --> 00:41:20,609
(chain rattling)

757
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,344
[Jess] Come on, oh my god!

758
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,310
(banging)

759
00:41:23,312 --> 00:41:24,846
Open the fucking door.

760
00:41:24,848 --> 00:41:26,848
Open the door!

761
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,319
(screaming)

762
00:41:31,421 --> 00:41:33,290
Open the goddamn door!

763
00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:41,029
Hey!

764
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,364
Hey!

765
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:43,964
Open the goddamn door.

766
00:41:43,966 --> 00:41:45,033
[Jess] What are you doing?

767
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:47,601
There's a goddamn
fucking camera around here.

768
00:41:47,603 --> 00:41:49,437
Fucking open the door!

769
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:51,241
[Angie] Let us out!

770
00:41:59,482 --> 00:42:01,218
- Let us out!
- Help!

771
00:42:02,986 --> 00:42:05,987
Let us out, let us out, let us
out!

772
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:08,422
[Ben] Open the door!

773
00:42:08,424 --> 00:42:10,560
(wailing)

774
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,495
What do we do?

775
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,899
(eerie music)

776
00:42:24,607 --> 00:42:27,611
(crickets chirping)

777
00:42:28,844 --> 00:42:31,915
(somber piano music)

778
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:34,317
Shit.

779
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:02,412
[Molly] Whatcha doin' out
here?

780
00:43:03,913 --> 00:43:05,612
Lost the camera in the room.

781
00:43:05,614 --> 00:43:06,848
What, when?

782
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,616
A few minutes ago.

783
00:43:08,618 --> 00:43:11,886
Okay, so what do you wanna do?

784
00:43:11,888 --> 00:43:12,821
I don't know.

785
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,022
It's never happened before.

786
00:43:15,024 --> 00:43:16,290
I've been on the phone to the
company

787
00:43:16,292 --> 00:43:18,592
for the past 10 minutes trying
to get 'em to troubleshoot it

788
00:43:18,594 --> 00:43:20,060
but no one picks up.

789
00:43:20,062 --> 00:43:21,462
Did you check the modem?

790
00:43:21,464 --> 00:43:23,598
It's hardwired.

791
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,468
Mm.

792
00:43:25,368 --> 00:43:26,935
Should you go check on it?

793
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,803
Is it a liability thing?

794
00:43:28,805 --> 00:43:30,739
A bit of a gray area.

795
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,373
Okay, why don't you just go in
there

796
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:33,308
and pause the game for a
second...

797
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,676
- No, no no no no.
- To reset the camera.

798
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:35,476
Absolutely not.

799
00:43:35,478 --> 00:43:36,310
They are in there, in the
moment.

800
00:43:36,312 --> 00:43:38,379
I'm not gonna pull 'em out of it
now.

801
00:43:38,381 --> 00:43:39,348
It'll ruin it.

802
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,915
Blowing it out of
proportion much, are we?

803
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:42,549
Blowing it out of proportion,
Molly?

804
00:43:42,551 --> 00:43:44,618
One of the guys in there,
he's a horror reviewer

805
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,786
for Bloodlust.com.

806
00:43:45,788 --> 00:43:47,755
His reviews get a lotta traffic.

807
00:43:47,757 --> 00:43:49,491
Okay, so what you're saying
is,

808
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:51,058
you're like the chef that's
terrified

809
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,826
of what the food critic's gonna
write

810
00:43:52,828 --> 00:43:54,832
about your filet mignon?

811
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,433
It just takes one bad review

812
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:03,036
from someone like that,
one, and we are history.

813
00:44:03,038 --> 00:44:03,908
So what?

814
00:44:08,578 --> 00:44:10,047
Just ride it out.

815
00:44:11,814 --> 00:44:13,781
I'll fix the camera before
the next group comes in,

816
00:44:13,783 --> 00:44:16,484
but we are not stopping the
game.

817
00:44:16,486 --> 00:44:17,719
Okay.

818
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:20,524
I don't think that's a good
idea.

819
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:34,701
Fuck you.
(glass shattering)

820
00:44:34,703 --> 00:44:36,170
Fuckin' asshole.

821
00:44:36,172 --> 00:44:37,471
Fuck you.

822
00:44:37,473 --> 00:44:40,477
(suspenseful music)

823
00:44:42,645 --> 00:44:45,779
Angie, where's your cell phone?

824
00:44:45,781 --> 00:44:47,882
Angie, hey, Angie,
where's your cell phone?

825
00:44:47,884 --> 00:44:49,016
(wailing)

826
00:44:49,018 --> 00:44:50,518
- Geez, Angie, Angie...
- Oh my god!

827
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,652
- Angie, Angie!
- We're gonna die in here!

828
00:44:51,654 --> 00:44:53,020
- No, Angie.
- We're gonna die in here!

829
00:44:53,022 --> 00:44:54,188
Angie, you're not gonna die.

830
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,223
Just like he killed Jeff!

831
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:56,324
You're not gonna die.

832
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:59,460
Shut up, shut up and listen,
listen to me, all right?

833
00:44:59,462 --> 00:45:00,328
You're gonna be fine.

834
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,062
We're gonna get out of here, all
right,

835
00:45:02,064 --> 00:45:04,132
but I need you, I need
you to keep it together.

836
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:05,098
Look at me.

837
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,768
Jeff. (crying)

838
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:11,605
I know, I know, but
you gotta push that down.

839
00:45:11,607 --> 00:45:14,775
You gotta push that down
and be strong for us, okay?

840
00:45:14,777 --> 00:45:16,109
'Cause we need you.

841
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:18,045
We need to be strong, okay?

842
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:19,681
'Cause we're gonna get outta
here,

843
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:22,152
we're gonna be fine, all right?

844
00:45:23,853 --> 00:45:25,823
Where's your cell phone?

845
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,794
In my, in my purse.

846
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,926
Okay, okay.

847
00:45:31,928 --> 00:45:32,794
[Jess] What about the signal?

848
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,995
It's, it's, we gotta try
something.

849
00:45:34,997 --> 00:45:36,063
[Jess] There's no signal...

850
00:45:36,065 --> 00:45:39,100
What other idea is there?

851
00:45:39,102 --> 00:45:40,971
We gotta do something.

852
00:45:44,107 --> 00:45:45,643
Come on, come on.

853
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,275
Come on, damn it!

854
00:45:48,277 --> 00:45:49,544
Don't move, okay?

855
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:50,879
Don't move, just stay here.

856
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,114
There's gotta be a fuckin'
signal.

857
00:45:53,116 --> 00:45:53,984
Fuck me.

858
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:58,920
It's okay.

859
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,522
It's really not.

860
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:01,755
(groaning)

861
00:46:01,757 --> 00:46:03,960
(mumbling)

862
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:07,694
(sweater ripping)

863
00:46:07,696 --> 00:46:09,032
It's all right.

864
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:18,609
[Jess] You're lucky that
you didn't cut an artery.

865
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,117
It's okay.

866
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:32,053
I'm scared.

867
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:34,688
I'm scared, really scared.

868
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:36,759
(crying)

869
00:46:42,565 --> 00:46:45,900
(chain rattling)

870
00:46:45,902 --> 00:46:46,770
Oh my god.

871
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:54,942
(scissors scraping)

872
00:46:54,944 --> 00:46:57,011
Get back, get back.

873
00:46:57,013 --> 00:47:00,084
(eerie string music)

874
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:23,071
We have to keep playing the
game.

875
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:24,371
What?

876
00:47:24,373 --> 00:47:26,174
[Ben] We have to keep playing
the game

877
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,176
and get out of here.

878
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,011
Ben, this is not a game
anymore.

879
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,179
What are you talking about?

880
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:31,879
No one's gonna save us.

881
00:47:31,881 --> 00:47:33,214
Yes they will, they have to.

882
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:34,382
If you're gonna bet your life
on that,

883
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:37,752
because in 30 minutes he's
gonna be right on top of us.

884
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:40,621
[Jess] Oh my god, I can't
believe this is happening.

885
00:47:40,623 --> 00:47:43,658
Look, we have to get
ourselves out, all right?

886
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,092
That is our only choice.

887
00:47:45,094 --> 00:47:46,794
I can't, I can't.

888
00:47:46,796 --> 00:47:48,663
My brain doesn't work like
yours.

889
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:50,665
I can't do puzzles, I can't do
it.

890
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,333
- [Ben] Hey, hey, hey.
- I can't do it.

891
00:47:52,335 --> 00:47:53,033
We got to.

892
00:47:53,035 --> 00:47:55,636
We don't have another choice.

893
00:47:55,638 --> 00:47:57,638
We've lost a lotta time.

894
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,009
You and me, you and me, we
can get through this, okay?

895
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:02,877
Okay.

896
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:03,745
Yeah?

897
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:04,578
Okay.

898
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,617
Okay, all right, come on, come
on.

899
00:48:22,064 --> 00:48:22,932
Okay.

900
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:25,933
All right.

901
00:48:25,935 --> 00:48:28,169
I don't wanna overthink it,
just,

902
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:30,370
okay, we need four coins to get
the key.

903
00:48:30,372 --> 00:48:31,772
We have coins.

904
00:48:31,774 --> 00:48:33,408
Yeah, we've got two coins
already.

905
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,243
We need two more, there's
two left somewhere.

906
00:48:36,245 --> 00:48:39,746
All right, uh, they
gotta be here somewhere.

907
00:48:39,748 --> 00:48:41,716
Okay, it's gotta be right in
front of us.

908
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:42,783
We've already checked
everything,

909
00:48:42,785 --> 00:48:46,956
so it's gotta be somewhere
right in front of us.

910
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:49,891
[Jess] The paintings.

911
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:51,161
Oh yeah, okay.

912
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:56,330
This, this,

913
00:48:56,332 --> 00:48:57,330
will it move?

914
00:48:57,332 --> 00:48:58,366
[Jess] No, it won't move.

915
00:48:58,368 --> 00:48:59,433
- [Ben] It's not moving?
- No.

916
00:48:59,435 --> 00:49:02,303
Okay, it's gotta mean
something.

917
00:49:02,305 --> 00:49:03,172
Fuck.

918
00:49:05,207 --> 00:49:06,808
It's just fucking triangles, all
right?

919
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,810
It's the same as that
color black in the books.

920
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,212
We gotta figure out where it
fits

921
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:12,379
with the patterns.

922
00:49:12,381 --> 00:49:13,248
I don't see any other
triangle.

923
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,415
We just have to step back, all
right,

924
00:49:14,417 --> 00:49:18,252
just step back and look at
it simply and figure it out.

925
00:49:18,254 --> 00:49:19,323
Okay, okay.

926
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:22,390
Wait a second, wait, wait,
wait.

927
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,824
What?

928
00:49:23,826 --> 00:49:25,426
(clicking)
Oh, they're punch keys!

929
00:49:25,428 --> 00:49:27,929
Okay, that's why it's
not a real painting.

930
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,263
There's somethin' behind it.

931
00:49:29,265 --> 00:49:33,170
Just have to figure out
how to fucking open it.

932
00:49:35,071 --> 00:49:39,143
(voices whispering indistinctly)

933
00:49:43,212 --> 00:49:44,080
Angie.

934
00:49:48,484 --> 00:49:49,886
Please, please.

935
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:52,855
Oh.

936
00:49:58,861 --> 00:49:59,729
Angie.

937
00:50:01,464 --> 00:50:03,163
Please.

938
00:50:03,165 --> 00:50:04,832
Help me.

939
00:50:04,834 --> 00:50:07,904
(eerie string music)

940
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,210
Help me.

941
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:16,310
They're connected somehow.

942
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:19,781
These are, they're connected,
I just can't figure out how.

943
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:20,851
I love you.

944
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:23,187
I love you, Angie.

945
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:30,828
Don't let me die, please.

946
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:35,395
(raspy breathing)

947
00:50:35,397 --> 00:50:38,098
(crying)

948
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,236
Just, hold me.

949
00:50:48,076 --> 00:50:49,944
(chain rattling)

950
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:51,545
[Angie] He's alive.

951
00:50:51,547 --> 00:50:53,281
- Angie!
- What are doing?

952
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:55,516
(stabbing)

953
00:50:55,518 --> 00:50:57,988
(screaming)

954
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:00,524
Fuck you!

955
00:51:01,924 --> 00:51:03,392
Fuck you, fuck you!

956
00:51:05,594 --> 00:51:07,828
(thudding)

957
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:08,498
Oh no!

958
00:51:09,498 --> 00:51:11,768
(crying)

959
00:51:25,547 --> 00:51:28,516
I'm sorry, but we have to keep
going.

960
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:29,449
Don't look.

961
00:51:29,451 --> 00:51:31,118
We have to keep going.

962
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,587
Come on, we can do this.

963
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,453
No.

964
00:51:33,455 --> 00:51:34,524
We have to.

965
00:51:36,392 --> 00:51:38,292
We gotta keep going.

966
00:51:38,294 --> 00:51:39,926
Just don't look, all right?

967
00:51:39,928 --> 00:51:41,929
Don't look over there, focus on
me,

968
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:43,496
focus on me, okay?

969
00:51:43,498 --> 00:51:45,301
We can do this, okay?

970
00:51:47,203 --> 00:51:48,169
Come on, come on.

971
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,239
Okay, okay.

972
00:51:52,408 --> 00:51:53,277
Okay.

973
00:51:54,576 --> 00:51:57,113
(whimpering)

974
00:51:58,547 --> 00:51:59,415
Jess.

975
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:03,951
You got it, you got it.

976
00:52:03,953 --> 00:52:05,219
I got it, okay, yeah.

977
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:07,355
These other triangles are just
pointing away from each other

978
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:08,422
or at each other.

979
00:52:08,424 --> 00:52:09,891
Okay.

980
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:12,192
Punch these in, punch these in.

981
00:52:12,194 --> 00:52:14,328
It's right, left,
(clicking)

982
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:16,366
left, right, right, left,

983
00:52:17,366 --> 00:52:20,134
left, right, right, left.

984
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:21,101
You're fine.

985
00:52:21,103 --> 00:52:22,303
(creaking)

986
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,170
Okay.

987
00:52:23,172 --> 00:52:24,038
There's coins.

988
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,205
[Jess] There's coins, there's
coins.

989
00:52:25,207 --> 00:52:25,906
Let's go.

990
00:52:25,908 --> 00:52:29,109
All right, come on, come on.

991
00:52:29,111 --> 00:52:29,979
Okay.

992
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,482
(coins clanking)

993
00:52:36,551 --> 00:52:38,652
Do you have the other coins?

994
00:52:38,654 --> 00:52:40,187
No, no I don't.

995
00:52:40,189 --> 00:52:42,355
Who had the coins last?

996
00:52:42,357 --> 00:52:45,326
(tapping)

997
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:48,398
(eerie string music)

998
00:52:58,473 --> 00:53:00,942
[Molly] Turns out, it's
not such a gray area.

999
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:01,641
What?

1000
00:53:01,643 --> 00:53:03,377
The security camera.

1001
00:53:03,379 --> 00:53:04,612
If it's not functioning,

1002
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:06,647
you're supposed to shut
everything down.

1003
00:53:06,649 --> 00:53:08,683
I'm not hearing you right
now, I'm not listening.

1004
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:12,118
Sorry boss, if anything
goes wrong in there,

1005
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,721
you are on the hook in a big
way.

1006
00:53:14,723 --> 00:53:16,991
Just go in there and tell 'em
what's up.

1007
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:17,958
They'll understand.

1008
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,430
No!
(banging)

1009
00:53:23,498 --> 00:53:25,535
(crying)

1010
00:53:28,236 --> 00:53:32,008
(low, ominous humming music)

1011
00:53:40,149 --> 00:53:41,449
I have an idea.

1012
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,384
Don't look at me, no, no, look
down.

1013
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,250
Why?

1014
00:53:44,252 --> 00:53:45,922
He's watching us.

1015
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:49,190
I don't wanna tip him off.

1016
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:52,525
We need every advantage we can
get, okay?

1017
00:53:52,527 --> 00:53:55,998
There's a smoke detector on the
ceiling.

1018
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I've got my lighter in my
pocket.

1019
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:01,471
You told me you quit smoking.

1020
00:54:02,471 --> 00:54:04,672
We'll talk about that later.

1021
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:06,040
Yeah.

1022
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:06,710
Okay.

1023
00:54:08,176 --> 00:54:11,344
All right, we need to spark the
lighter

1024
00:54:11,346 --> 00:54:12,746
and try and set off the alarm,

1025
00:54:12,748 --> 00:54:15,149
see if we can get some help in
here.

1026
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:16,085
[Jess] Okay.

1027
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:22,392
The problem is, it's
right behind him, okay?

1028
00:54:23,725 --> 00:54:28,629
So I need you to take the
lighter and spark it up.

1029
00:54:28,631 --> 00:54:30,130
Are you crazy?

1030
00:54:30,132 --> 00:54:31,732
Unless you wanna do what I'm
gonna do.

1031
00:54:31,734 --> 00:54:33,634
[Jess] What are you gonna do?

1032
00:54:33,636 --> 00:54:35,639
I'm gonna be the bait.

1033
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,409
Give me the lighter.

1034
00:54:43,312 --> 00:54:46,216
Okay, here's what we're gonna
do.

1035
00:54:47,149 --> 00:54:50,419
(indistinct whispering)

1036
00:55:05,567 --> 00:55:07,770
(grunting)

1037
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:32,763
(glass crunching)

1038
00:55:39,734 --> 00:55:42,538
Come on, come on, I'm right
here.

1039
00:55:44,806 --> 00:55:47,576
(chain rattling)

1040
00:55:54,817 --> 00:55:56,553
Okay, yeah, come on.

1041
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:02,388
(pulsing, dramatic music)

1042
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:03,824
(screaming)

1043
00:56:03,826 --> 00:56:05,525
Jess, hurry up.

1044
00:56:05,527 --> 00:56:06,659
Hurry up.

1045
00:56:06,661 --> 00:56:07,527
I'm trying.

1046
00:56:07,529 --> 00:56:08,795
[Ben] Come on!

1047
00:56:08,797 --> 00:56:10,730
(metal clanking)

1048
00:56:10,732 --> 00:56:13,567
Jess, come on, push it, push it.

1049
00:56:13,569 --> 00:56:14,801
I got it!

1050
00:56:14,803 --> 00:56:18,339
[Ben] Jess go, go!
(screaming)

1051
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:20,207
(crashing)

1052
00:56:20,209 --> 00:56:20,875
[Jess] Are you okay?

1053
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,576
Yeah.

1054
00:56:22,578 --> 00:56:24,714
(panting)

1055
00:56:26,448 --> 00:56:28,149
Why didn't it work?

1056
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:29,352
I don't know.

1057
00:56:32,687 --> 00:56:35,491
We're not gonna get another
shot.

1058
00:56:42,931 --> 00:56:46,268
(somber string music)

1059
00:56:49,705 --> 00:56:52,308
I don't wanna die like this.

1060
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,750
[Molly] You ever play hockey?

1061
00:57:03,752 --> 00:57:04,786
What?

1062
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:07,254
They would this gripping
the stick too tight.

1063
00:57:07,256 --> 00:57:08,455
What are you talking about?

1064
00:57:08,457 --> 00:57:10,891
Gripping the stick too tight,

1065
00:57:10,893 --> 00:57:11,761
nevermind.

1066
00:57:13,328 --> 00:57:15,395
You just need to calm it down.

1067
00:57:15,397 --> 00:57:17,730
Shift it back into neutral for a
bit.

1068
00:57:17,732 --> 00:57:19,900
The tree trunk, that stays put,

1069
00:57:19,902 --> 00:57:23,304
but the branch leaves,
they just, they fall.

1070
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:25,705
I'm losing track of
your analogies, Molly.

1071
00:57:25,707 --> 00:57:26,575
So am I.

1072
00:57:27,576 --> 00:57:29,976
Let's just keep our eye
on the eight ball here.

1073
00:57:29,978 --> 00:57:32,346
Sorry, I just did it again.

1074
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:35,783
You are driving yourself
crazy, over nothing.

1075
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:39,388
Just do the smart thing and stop
the game.

1076
00:57:40,522 --> 00:57:41,621
It happens.

1077
00:57:41,623 --> 00:57:44,891
This one glitch is not gonna
kill your entire season,

1078
00:57:44,893 --> 00:57:46,794
but if anything goes wrong in
there...

1079
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,198
Oh, just wait, just wait.

1080
00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:51,632
I'll pull up the recorded
footage

1081
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,266
and see what it shows.

1082
00:57:53,268 --> 00:57:55,268
If anything, we'll see
that everything was fine

1083
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:56,469
before the feed went dead.

1084
00:57:56,471 --> 00:57:59,505
And if so, we'll let them finish
the game.

1085
00:57:59,507 --> 00:58:02,779
They're getting close to the end
anyway.

1086
00:58:13,788 --> 00:58:15,788
It doesn't look like
anyone's messing with it.

1087
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:17,794
No, not yet, at least.

1088
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,495
Woah, is that RJ?

1089
00:58:22,497 --> 00:58:25,266
- [Molly] What?
- What the hell is he doing?

1090
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:27,368
Has he never seen a camera
before?

1091
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,402
More importantly, why the
hell is he breaking character,

1092
00:58:29,404 --> 00:58:30,473
the dumb ass.

1093
00:58:32,841 --> 00:58:35,444
(eerie music)

1094
00:58:37,279 --> 00:58:40,781
[Molly] Dude, did he
just pull the wires out?

1095
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:43,549
Yeah, I think he did.

1096
00:58:43,551 --> 00:58:45,953
[Molly] Why would he do that?

1097
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:46,886
No idea.

1098
00:58:46,888 --> 00:58:49,291
(clicking)

1099
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:14,815
Come on.
(banging)

1100
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:17,020
(grunting)

1101
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:29,431
(chain rattling)

1102
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:18,547
I know that look.

1103
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:21,618
Ben, talk to me.

1104
01:00:23,085 --> 01:00:25,752
We can't just keep sitting
here.

1105
01:00:25,754 --> 01:00:27,554
I'm not gonna go down that easy.

1106
01:00:27,556 --> 01:00:28,422
Babe.

1107
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:31,158
Look, he holds the only shot
we have

1108
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,859
of getting out of here in his
hand.

1109
01:00:32,861 --> 01:00:33,527
What, the coins?

1110
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:35,395
No, forget about them, okay?

1111
01:00:35,397 --> 01:00:37,063
The bait worked last time,
it's not gonna work again.

1112
01:00:37,065 --> 01:00:38,998
[Ben] No, no, no bait this
time.

1113
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,167
[Jess] What are you gonna do?

1114
01:00:41,169 --> 01:00:42,603
I'm gonna go get them.

1115
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:43,804
No.

1116
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,440
No, don't even think about it.

1117
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:47,440
Are you out of your mind?

1118
01:00:47,442 --> 01:00:50,676
No just look, look,
we are out of options.

1119
01:00:50,678 --> 01:00:51,779
We need those coins.

1120
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:53,116
And I need you.

1121
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:58,185
As soon as you get them,
put them in the slot,

1122
01:00:58,187 --> 01:00:59,719
and get the key out.

1123
01:00:59,721 --> 01:01:01,788
You'll need to move fast.

1124
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:03,656
You mean, we'll have to move
fast.

1125
01:01:03,658 --> 01:01:05,658
We've lost a lot of time
already.

1126
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:07,694
No, I'm not gonna let you do
this.

1127
01:01:07,696 --> 01:01:10,964
Just, keep a clear head, okay?

1128
01:01:10,966 --> 01:01:12,533
You can solve the puzzles.

1129
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:14,967
They're simpler than you think,
all right?

1130
01:01:14,969 --> 01:01:16,069
You can do this.

1131
01:01:16,071 --> 01:01:17,837
No, I can't do it by myself.

1132
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:20,641
You can do this, you can.

1133
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:24,647
(gentle string and piano music)

1134
01:01:38,694 --> 01:01:39,763
I love you.

1135
01:01:53,107 --> 01:01:54,910
I'll be right back.

1136
01:02:06,788 --> 01:02:09,859
(low, ominous music)

1137
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,853
(scissors scraping)

1138
01:02:40,855 --> 01:02:42,221
That's the only thing you got,
huh?

1139
01:02:42,223 --> 01:02:43,891
Drop the scissors.

1140
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:46,161
Drop them, fight like a man.

1141
01:02:48,163 --> 01:02:50,029
Come on, asshole.

1142
01:02:50,031 --> 01:02:52,901
(glass crunching)

1143
01:02:53,801 --> 01:02:54,736
Okay, okay.

1144
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:57,073
All right.

1145
01:03:00,308 --> 01:03:02,074
(thudding)

1146
01:03:02,076 --> 01:03:03,576
(yelling)

1147
01:03:03,578 --> 01:03:05,781
(stabbing)

1148
01:03:07,248 --> 01:03:09,651
(whacking)

1149

What the hell?

1191
01:08:46,554 --> 01:08:47,987

1192

(bell ringing)

1247
01:20:04,131 --> 01:20:05,932
[Ramona] I see.

1248
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:07,633
You are an acquaintance of...

1249
01:20:07,635 --> 01:20:08,704
Brice, yes.

1250
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:11,704
I worked for him, but...

1251
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:12,641
Yes, but.

1252
01:20:14,108 --> 01:20:17,142
Thank you for returning it.

1253
01:20:17,144 --> 01:20:20,812
I thought if I returned it,
it would make things right,

1254
01:20:20,814 --> 01:20:22,748
bring Brice back.

1255
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:25,084
Oh it's much too late for
that, my dear.

1256
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:27,085
The beast has been let out.

1257
01:20:27,087 --> 01:20:27,956
Yes.

1258
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:34,226
You've seen it, haven't you?

1259
01:20:34,228 --> 01:20:35,096
Up close.

1260
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:38,000
What is it?

1261
01:20:41,068 --> 01:20:44,169
I tried to warn him, you
understand.

1262
01:20:44,171 --> 01:20:47,039
There is true evil out there,

1263
01:20:47,041 --> 01:20:50,843
evil that is both nameless and
timeless,

1264
01:20:50,845 --> 01:20:54,312
here by means that we do not
understand,

1265
01:20:54,314 --> 01:20:58,185
whose origin we cannot
begin to conceptualize,

1266
01:20:59,153 --> 01:21:03,292
whose purpose, beyond death
and suffering, is unknown.

1267
01:21:04,692 --> 01:21:08,893
Some people can accept this,
some cannot.

1268
01:21:08,895 --> 01:21:09,764
Can you?

1269
01:21:12,332 --> 01:21:16,671
This demon never forgets a
face, and he's seen yours.

1270
01:21:17,804 --> 01:21:20,942
He's a patient little devil,
this one.

1271
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:24,613
One day, in a week, or a month,

1272
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:28,414
or 50 years from now,

1273
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:30,152
he may come for you.

1274
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:37,292
